## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway
1. [ ] Create Railway account and new project
2. [ ] Connect GitHub repository
3. [ ] Set root directory to `backend`
4. [ ] Add PostgreSQL database service
5. [ ] Configure environment variables:
   - [ ] `FLASK_ENV=production`
   - [ ] `SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key`
   - [ ] `FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - [ ] `DEBUG=False`
6. [ ] Deploy and test health endpoint
7. [ ] Note backend URL for frontend configuration

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel
1. [ ] Create Vercel account and new project
2. [ ] Connect GitHub repository
3. [ ] Set root directory to `frontend`
4. [ ] Update `vercel.json` with actual backend URL
5. [ ] Add environment variable:
   - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app`
6. [ ] Deploy and test frontend

### Step 3: Final Configuration
1. [ ] Update Railway `FRONTEND_URL` with actual Vercel URL
2. [ ] Redeploy backend to apply CORS changes
3. [ ] Test full application functionality

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Backend Tests
- [ ] Health check: `GET https://your-backend.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] Model info: `GET https://your-backend.railway.app/api/model/info`
- [ ] Crop prediction: `POST https://your-backend.railway.app/api/predict`
- [ ] All crops: `GET https://your-backend.railway.app/api/crops`

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Crop recommendation form works
- [ ] API calls to backend successful
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

### Full Integration Tests
- [ ] Submit crop recommendation form
- [ ] Receive prediction results
- [ ] Check analytics page
- [ ] Verify all features work end-to-end

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Reference

### Railway (Backend)
```
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=generate-a-strong-secret-key
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.vercel.app
DEBUG=False
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (auto-set by Railway)
PORT=auto-set by Railway
```

### Vercel (Frontend)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-name.railway.app
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- [ ] Both services deploy without errors
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] ML model trains and makes predictions
- [ ] All application features work in production
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting
- Check deployment logs in both platforms
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure CORS configuration allows frontend domain
- Test API endpoints individually if frontend fails
- Check that ML model data file is included in deployment
